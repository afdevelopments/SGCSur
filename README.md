# SGCSur - Convention Management System CUSur

SGCSur is a web system developed in Django aimed at capturing existing agreements of the Southern University Center of the University of Guadalajara.

## System Modules

The system is divided into the following modules:

### Companies

In this module, companies with which agreements are made can be registered.

### Programs

In this module, the programs offered on the campus can be registered.

### Contacts

### Agreements

In this module, the agreements made with companies can be registered. Each agreement has a name, a description, its start date, its expiration date, and certain notes that may be relevant.

### Reports

In this module, statistical reports about the information registered in the system can be generated. Reports can be filtered by program, company, or agreement date.
